# R interface for OSQP

Provides R-bindings to [OSQP](https://osqp.org/): the Operator Splitting
QP Solver.

The OSQP (Operator Splitting Quadratic Program) solver is a numerical
optimization package for solving problems in the form

``` R
minimize        0.5 x' P x + q' x

subject to      l <= A x <= u
```

where `x in R^n` is the optimization variable. The objective function is
defined by a positive semidefinite matrix `P in S^n_+` and vector
`q in R^n`. The linear constraints are defined by matrix
`A in R^{m x n}` and vectors `l in R^m U {-inf}^m`,
`u in R^m U {+inf}^m`.

## Documentation

The interface is documented [here](https://osqp.org/).
